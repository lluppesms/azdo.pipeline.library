# Lyle's Azure Pipelines Library

This repository contains a collection of Azure Pipelines, Pipes, and Templates that I have created and used in my own projects.  I hope that you find them useful as well.

There are three main categories of resources in this repository:

- The **pipeline_examples** folder contains the main files that you will want to copy to your projects and modify. Hopefully, all of the other files will be referenced and not copied to your projects.

- The **pipes** folder contains pipes that will be reused in projects that use this repo. These files should *NOT* be copied to your projects.

- The **templates** folder contains templates that will be reused in projects that use this repo. These files should *NOT* be copied to your projects.
